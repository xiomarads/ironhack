How to work with Javascript inside of a Rails project

How to organize our code in Javascript inside of Rails (Rails has no opinions on how to organize JS inside of Rails...)

Deciding when maybe there will be a need to use Ajax/Jquery/Javascript to make the user experience better (not having to refresh every time).

How to split our code into logical smaller modules (in JS)?

Components, keeping responsibilities separate.
Components are widgets in our app.

javascrip in Rails lives in app, assets, javasrcript

in rails, within the layouts folder in the application html.erb notice the javascript include tag, a method that includes the script tags on main index html, which means we don't have to include it manually.  It does the same for the CSS files.

all javascript is included and bundled up because of the  //= require jquery, //= require twitter/bootstrap, etc

//= require_tree . (includes everything on the JS folder)

when defining functions, etc needs to be protected by attaching it to the only global variable
