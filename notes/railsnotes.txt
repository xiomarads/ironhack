Ruby on Rails notes (7.11.16)

- Ruby (language)
- Ruby on rails (framework)
- it is a collection of gems
- check out "basecamp" app (from the creator of rails)
- talk about creating a blog in 15 minutes (by the creator of rails)
- gem rails install
- rails new timetracking (creates a new project inside a designated folder)
- rails - - help
- routes: which pages you can visit in the app, starting from the homepage.  
- How to create those routes on Rails?
- when creating a new page in rails follow these steps"	
	1. Add "route"
	2. Create the "controller" (if necessary)   .... - command to create controller site:   rails generate controller site
	3. Add "action/method" (methods are called actions in rails)
	4. Create "view" (erb files)

- command to create controller site:   rails generate controller site
- command: rails server
- opposite of generate, destroy #command
- partial snippets have to begin with a _navigation


DAY 2 (Rails) (8.11.16)

Databases

- How can we save data in a web application? you need to write data to permanent storage--i.e. hard disk.
- Relational Databases/Relational Database Management System
- How do users, posts, tags interact with each other, saving that relationship.
- databases: tables. Each table saves 1 kind of data (1 for users, 1 for posts, 1 for tags, 1 for comments)
- Anything in Ruby that would be a class, would be a table on a database.
- Every row in the table, is one of those kinds of things. In the user table, every row is one individual user.
- Every column is individual piece of information for each user.
- Every row in a table will have an id (not always called id, conceptually it's called primary key) column, which makes the row unique. (on a per table basis).
- schema = structure of the databa
se. which tables do i have? and what columns do i have?  (not about the rows/content).
- without describing the structure, database won't know what you're talking about.
- how to relate different tables? who was the "author" of this "post"?  the association happens through the IDs.
- you have to describe the relationship between tables.
- relationships: one to many (or many to many, many to one). The many table must have the id of the one table.
- to represent a many to many relationship you need an extra table
		-Tables
		-Row
		-Column
		-Primary Key
		-Schema
- an added step when user tries to retrieve information. The app.rb will now know that it has access the database to retrieve specific information as part of the "business logic" in our models.
- CRUD (create read update delete rows)  data from a data source
- Ensure data format is valid
- Implement validations
- Single responsibility principle: an object should have on a single responsibility.
- Our goal for the day:  a list with the latest projects
- rails g model Project_name: string
- migration file represents a change to your schema, it's what tells what the structure will be.
- an Active Record ("ORM" object relational map) maps ruby objects to the database.  Classes are mapped to rows. Objects are mapped to rows.
- you can change the name of a table if you want, but by default Rails will use the plural of the class name.  It makes that assumption.
- command to get up date with migration: rails db:migrate
- schema.rb file represents the current of the structure in your database
- rails generate migration add_description_to_projects description:text   (adding columns) (add blah to projects) (description:text is the type of content) 
- check migrations on db migration files in the project
- if you make an empty migration use the destroy command
- easiest way to add rows is on rails console  command: rails console
- for simple queries on command line: my_project = Project.new, 
my_project.name = "Ironhack", my_project.description = "Description", my_project.save
- my_project variable is throwaway just to save to the database from the console, it's interchangable.
- to retrieve all projects:  projects = Project.all ("projects" variable is throwaway, "Projects" is refering to the model.)
- projects.length
- can do all methods from ruby (rails console is like PRY but with the rails framework and files available)
-Retrieving by attribute: Project.find_by(id: 1)
Project.find_by(name: "Ironhack") this is an exact match (id or name for example)
- Another option: Project.find(7)

- #where as a string with placeholders
Project.where("name=?", 'Ironhack')

-#where (negation)
Project.where.not("id < ?", 4)

- Retrieve with order (#order)
Project.order("created_at DESC")
Project.order("name ASC")

- Active support dates
d = Date.current
# => mon, 14 mar, 2016
d + 1.year
# => tue, 14 mar, 2017
d - 3.hours
# => mon, 14 Mar 2016 03:00

More queries

- Project.where.not(name: "Ironhack")
- date = Time.now.midnight - 1.month (between the last month and now)

Range queries

- from = Time.now.midnight - 1.day
- to = Time.now.midnight
- Project.where(updated_at: from..to)

- rails db:seed to add project from seeds.rb
- rails db:drop (deletes database (both structures and rows)
- rails db: create (to recreate it)
- rails db: migrate (because it's a new database)
- if you want to seeds again


- when looking at a rails app, the first to see is the routes, because it will tell you what other pages there are.

Word Central Solution (November 9th)

- For counting stuff in a loop, the best is to use a hash.

Faith of the 7 CRUD actions

There's 7 actions (specific routes and actions, pages)  IDs are very important for these pages.

1. index - displays lists (of projects, contacts, etc)
-----
2. new - shows the forms (the page that shows the form for creating something new for the database.)
3. create - receives the forms submission and goes on to create the thing that goes in the database.  Adds a row to our database.
-----> will never have a 'new' without the 'create'
-----

4. show - displays the details of a single thing, product, person, etc.

-----
5. edit - form for editing an existing thing.  whenever you make a mistake filling in the information.
6. update - process the forms
-----

7. destroy - deletes.

In order to create a new show page: on timetracker

1. create a  get '/projects/:id', to: 'projects#show' on routes.rb
2. then, add action to the projects controller 

def show
    @myproject = Project.find(params[:id])
    render :show
    end

 3. next, view

command for checking if a route has a prefix: rails routes
if it doesn't have one, add a name on routes.rb 
as: "project" or as: :project

then input project_path(variable) into the show.html.erb (this will replace hardcoding the id of each project)

Form types:

form_for ======> helpful when creating a new row or editing a new row on databases

TIME ENTRY TABLE

The table needs:
-project ID
-hours
-minutes
-comment
-date

Project
-name
-description

when there is association between tables, we have to wire the classes

-to enter a particular time entry to a particular project, you must look for the ID first:

On the terminal...

 => #<Project id: 10, name: "Amazonia", created_at: "2016-11-09 16:13:03", updated_at: "2016-11-09 16:13:03", description: "Design">
2.3.1 :002 > time_entry = TimeEntry.new(hours: 2, minutes: 30, Date.yesterday, comments: "did stuff", project_id: 10)

then save,

new_entry.save

then to check list of entries,

list_of_entries = TimeEntry.where(project_id: 10)

To facilitate retrieval of time entries:

2.3.1 :009 > proj10 = Project.find(10)
  Project Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "projects".* FROM "projects" WHERE "projects"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 10], ["LIMIT", 1]]
 => #<Project id: 10, name: "Amazonia", created_at: "2016-11-09 16:13:03", updated_at: "2016-11-09 16:13:03", description: "Design">


 same result with,

2.3.1 :010 > proj10.time_entries
  TimeEntry Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "time_entries".* FROM "time_entries" WHERE "time_entries"."project_id" = ?  [["project_id", 10]]
 => #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy [#<TimeEntry id: 1, project_id: 10, hours: 5, minutes: 25, comments: "worked on stuff", date: "2016-11-08 00:00:00", created_at: "2016-11-09 17:09:34", updated_at: "2016-11-09 17:09:34">]>
2.3.1 :011 >

- After time entries to projects on seeds.rb, make sure to drop, create, migrate, seed

- what are time_entries? It's almost like an array, ActiveRecord

- when you name the controller the same as a model, the controller is plural.

- to link to routes on view, must name the route 

- name of params is also the name of the action on the routes.


REVIEWS:

1. always start by generating route, controller, action, view for the home/landing page.
on routes:

instead of home '/' you can do root "landing_pages#casa"



RAILS (Day 4th-November 10th)  "Nested Routes & more"

On timetracker:

Creating an empty variable to create new time entry:
def new
    @myproject = Project.find(params[:project_id])
    @my_entry = @myproject.time_entries.new 

    #@myproject already exists
    #blank entry to add it to the existing project.
  end
end


When building the form for the view, for the new time entry that the user will input, remember the different types of inputs on each label.

Setting up validations under models in order to redirect user in case they didn't fill up the form correctly

Rails generates error messages automatically....we just have to display on the form by looping over them:
:
<% if @my_entry.errors.any? %>
  <ul>
    <% @my_entry.errors.full_messages.each do |error_msg| %>
    <li><%= error_msg %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>
<% end %>

- form for will alway display messages to save only correctly filled forms.

-feedback to the user. essential.

-UPDATING (in order to update the actual database)
....
on rails console
my_project = Project.find(1)  -----> retrieve from the database before
my_project.name = "Ironhack updated"
 => "Ironhack updated"
2.3.1 :003 > my_project.save

methods: deleting (destroy), updating

can destroy only 1 single object, not an array of objects

destroy_all, destroys all of an array

#patch is to give the rigth path name

for editing you use get and patch
for creating you use get and post

used strong parameters to refactor update and edit actions in time_entries_controller

command: rails server

- resource routing is a way to define all of the routes that we've just created in a much easier to read and short syntax.


resources :projects do
 resources :time_entries
(nested routes)
this block replaces the routes for new, create, edit, updates and all 7 CRUDS (only creates routes)


Friday Project 
ROCK WITH RAILS

Iteration 2:
2 lists of concerts: one for the day, one for the month
remember: date ranges (for the month would start today-end of month, for week, starting right now)

 Get at least to iteration 3
