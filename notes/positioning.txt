1. position property
- position: static;
- position absolute (gets rid of the greedy block display)
- position relative (uses from the original position to...)
- position absolute (uses the whole screen as a reference to...)
- position absolute takes away the original tag, unlike position relative keeps the tag in the original place. 
- position absolute does not adapt very well to all screen sizes
-floating is good for stacking things next to each other.  It doesn't move the other elements.
- overflow auto, makes the floats not act weird around other tags.
-clearfix technique (similar to overflow auto)
