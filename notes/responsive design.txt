responsive design notes

1. building a site that adapts to different sizes and remains usable.

2. 2 principless: responsive and adaptive
3. try to avoid too many fonts that they user has to download, it makes loading the website faster
4. vector (svg) images vs. regular images (jpg, gif for example), can scale infinetely.
5. if you know you'll be writing for mobile and desktop, start with phone design. (depends on the market you're building for)
