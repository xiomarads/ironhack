 Javascript

 1. Makes the user experience, in a web application, better
 (e.g. automatic liking on facebook without redirecting.)
 2. first time assigning a variable, must declare var
 3. when invoking a method in js, parentheses are required, not optional as in Ruby.
 4. instead of blocks as in Ruby, we use functions on js
 5. Ruby uses snake_case
 6. Javascript uses camelCase
 7. != ClassCase
 8. end in Javascript is the curly braces
 9. no implicit return in javascript, must type returns
