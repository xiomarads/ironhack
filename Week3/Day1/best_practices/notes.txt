HTML 

*Important jargon:

1. tag: <a> </a>
2. attributes: key value pairs, they have a name and a value
3. tags and image tags have special attributes: for <a> href= , for <img> src=.
4. head contains things that are not displayed on the browser and the title which shows on the tab form.
5. body content is displayed on the browser.

6. find tools for policing html
7. try to use tags for their intended purpose
8. html5 doctor = tool to figure out what each tag is for.
9. Have everything lowercase in the html part, to be able to tell code part from content part.
10. all values need to be quoted (whether single or double quotes).

11. name classes and id based on their role in the application and not on its mere look.
12. on <img src="jonshon.jpg" alt="Jon Snow"> => for screen readers, talks out the html of the page for people who can't see.  And for displaying a text is when the image does not load.  Try to do it very descriptive for people who cannot see and who will instead get a narration == make it accesible no matter what their particular situation is.
13. Google penalizes on the search results when you don't use alt or accesility tools.
14. Images which are not inherent part of the content, then use image background as part of css.
15. First thing to do is make sure everything is wired correctly.  CSS to HTML link etc.


16. Box model

.box {
	font-size: 40 px
	font_color: blue
	}
17. display properties depend on the tag and its predetermined display attribute, divs have block displays. This can be manipulated and changed.  Look at display values.
